  description: "The domain is bounded in the South by the 26.5° parallel, and by roughly the arctic polar circle in the North. The resolution is of 1/60° at the equator. In ORCA configuration, the size of the mesh is reduced with the cosinus of latitude, therefore horizontal resolution varies from 1600m at the southern boundary to 900m the nothermost part of the domain.
                   In order to correctly represent internal waves, it is imperative to have a high vertical resolution of 300 levels. At the surface the resolution is of 1m and of 50m in the deepest regions."
